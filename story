Once upon a time in a forest there lived a Monkey who resided on a jamun tree which was on the banks of a river.
In the same forest there lived a crocodile and his wife. One day a crocodile came to the bank of the river and
rested under the tree. The kind-hearted monkey offered him some fruits. The crocodile came back the next day for
more fruits as h loved them. As days passed by the crocodile and the monkey became good friends. 
One day the monkey sent some fruits for the crocodile's wife. She ate the fruits and liked them very much. She told
her husband if the fruits are so juicy, I wonder how sweet the monkey's heart would be. Get me the hearts of the
monkey.
